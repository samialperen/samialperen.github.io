<p>Most of the popular Adblock extensions like <a href="https://getadblock.com">AdBlock</a> or <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a> actually doesn’t provide full protection of ads. They started their way to promising this ideology, but after 2015 they became part of ridicilious <strong>Acceptable Ads Program</strong>, which basically means that you will still see some ads even if you use these extensions. I am sure you have already experienced this before. The reason behind this issue is the above Adblock extensions either purchased by advertisement agencies or they are getting paid by them. Yeah, I know this is annoying, but no worries. I have good news for you. I found a perfect AdBlock extension (at least for now) that blocks every advertisement. Its name is <strong>UBlock Origin</strong>. It is compatible with almost all web browsers. To get more info about it, you can visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin">UBlock Origin Wiki page</a>.</p>
