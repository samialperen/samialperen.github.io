In this post, I will try to give all necessary tips about living in Berlin, and I will also provide an awesome travel guide for you to discover the city.

## Accommodation & Transportation
If you are coming to Berlin as a tourist, accommodation won't cause any problem for you. There are many hotels or hostels in the Berlin.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to give specific hostel/hotel names. I stayed at **Pegasus Hostel Berlin** (near to Berlin Ostbahnhof) during my first visit to Berlin as a tourist, and it was okay. I can say that staying in a hotel which is close to city center would be beneficial for you. For this purpose, you may want to stay in **Mitte**, **Kreuzberg**, **Sch√∂neberg** districts of Berlin. Nonetheless, if you stay another district, that's okay as well since public transportation is quite advanced in Berlin and you can go anywhere you like using public transportation. During weekends, **SBahns** and **Ubahns** works all day including night. During weekdays, they are closed after some time at night, but there are **Night Buses** in the same routes. By the way, I should mention that **Buses** are always work 24 hour. Hence, transportation in Berlin never disappoints you. There are no ticket barriers in metro. You should buy appropriate ticket for you. Officers perform ticket check during the week at random times.
