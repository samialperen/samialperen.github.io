Hey, I am Sami Alperen Akgun. Welcome to my personal blog! In this blog, I will
try to share my experience and thoughts about academic life, travel, literature
technology, music, movies and TV-series. The language of the posts could be
either in English or Turkish. My main goal in the life is to move humans and 
robots close to each other through my research in robotics and 
human-robot interaction (HRI). Other than that, I find part time traveller title 
for myself quite suitable. I really enjoy to discover new places, meet different 
people from different cultures. I believe there is always something to learn. 
Please feel free to comment or make contact. I would be happy to meet with 
different people from various backgrounds and discuss about any topic. You can 
use or share anything in this blog as long as you provide refererence.
