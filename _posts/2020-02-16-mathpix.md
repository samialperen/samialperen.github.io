Although LaTeX and Overleaf makes your life easy when it comes to write a document and cite many papers, managing equations in LaTeX might be cumbersome sometimes. At least, that is the case for me nowadays. The problem about LaTeX and equations is even if you know all the syntax, you still need to waste a lot of time to type them into the document.

Luckily, I found the perfect tool to solve this problem, which is called **Mathpix Snip**. This tool gives you to the ability to convert equations (either in pdf files or handwritten notes doesn't matter) to LaTeX codes. It supports Mac, Windows and Linux. I tested on my Ubuntu 16.04 system and it worked like a charm. The program also has an app for both IOS and Android. According to the my experience, it doesn't work 100% correct every time, but still I am impressed by its performance. Trust me, use this tool once and you are not going to regret it!

You can visit its official webpage using [this link](https://mathpix.com/). 

P.S. I didn't take any money to advertise this tool :). I just feel sorry that I didn't discover it before!
