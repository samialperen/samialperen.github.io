When I first started programming with C, I always wondered what happens before **main()**. The post [A General Overview of What Happens Before main()](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2019/04/08/a-general-overview-of-what-happens-before-main/) by Phillip Johnston explains behind the scenes of a **C/C++** program. 

In case the posts are not available anymore, [here](/docs/before-main/A General Overview of What Happens Before main() - Embedded Artistry.pdf) is the pdf version.
