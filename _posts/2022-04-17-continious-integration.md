Once start working on a quite large repository where many developers are pushing code, merging their branches and resolving merge conflicts, I realized the importance of **Continious Integration (CI)**. Sebastian Castro's (who is a robotics software engineer at Boston Dynamics) post [Continuous Integration with GitHub, Docker, and Jenkins](https://roboticseabass.com/2020/05/12/continuous-integration-with-github-docker-and-jenkins/) helped me a lot to clarify the concept more. If you always hear about **CI/CD**, **Jenkins**, **Travis CI** or **Docker** but never had a chance to stratch the surface, his post might be a great help!

In case the post is not available anymore, [here](/docs/continious-integration/Continuous Integration with GitHub, Docker, and Jenkins - Robotic Sea Bass.pdf) is the pdf version.
