Every once in a while, I came across with a great course, but I keep forgetting them later. In this post, I want to share the courses I am planning to follow this year. Realistically, I won't be able to finish all of them in one year, but still this list might be useful for you too :) 

(I will keep editing this post with more cool resources)

* **[C++ For Yourself](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself):** Sensor fusion and localization engineer Igor Bogoslavskyi explains modern C++ in this course with practical assignments.
* **[fast.ai's Deep Learning Course](https://www.fast.ai/):** This course by Jeremy Howard is a great complement to Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization since this course explains more about the practical applications with examples.
* **[Introduction to Robotics by Princeton University](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/intro-to-robotics/):** Finally, I found a modern introduction to robotics course which is available online for free and not from ages ago. Huge thanks to course intructor Anirudha Majumdar.
* **[Welcome to Basic Knowledge on Visual SLAM: From Theory to Practice, by Xiang Gao, Tao Zhang, Qinrui Yan and Yi Liu](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook-en):** Finding a SLAM course online is quite difficult. I want to explore this book to see how much it covers the topic. I hope I can find some practical examples too.
* **[Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics):** If I magically happen to have more time, I wanna dive into this course to gain a deeper understanding of robotics theory.
* **[Book - Foundation of Robotics: A Multidisciplinary Approach with Python and ROS](https://foundations-of-robotics.org/):** This book seems like a easy read. I am planing to skim it to make sure that I do not have a gap in my knowlodge about robotics fundementals.
* **[Coursera - First Principles of Computer Vision Specialization by Colombia University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/firstprinciplesofcomputervision):** This coursera specialization seems to be a great way to learn the theory behind the general computer vision.
* **[Udacity -- Become a Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree Program]:** This nanodegree program is more tailored towards obstacle detection, especially for robotics applications. It explains how to fuse LIDAR, RADAR and camera data with Kalman filters.
