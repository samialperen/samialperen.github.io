Most of the popular Adblock extensions like [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com) or [AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) actually doesn't provide full protection of ads. They started their way to promising this ideology, but after 2015 they became part of ridicilious **Acceptable Ads Program**, which basically means that you will still see some ads even if you use these extensions. I am sure you have already experienced this before. The reason behind this issue is the above Adblock extensions either purchased by advertisement agencies or they are getting paid by them. Yeah, I know this is annoying, but no worries. I have good news for you. I found a perfect AdBlock extension (at least for now) that blocks every advertisement. Its name is **UBlock Origin**. It is compatible with almost all web browsers. To get more info about it, you can visit [UBlock Origin Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin). 

If you want to learn more about the subject, you can see this amazing [Medium post](https://medium.com/@trybravery/please-stop-using-adblock-but-not-why-you-think-13280e76c8e7).

I hope this will help!
