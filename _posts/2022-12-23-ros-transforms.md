Foxglove's blog post [Understanding ROS Transforms](https://foxglove.dev/blog/understanding-ros-transforms) explains coordinate transforms crystal clear with a practical example in ROS. I highly suggest to take a look if you are not comfortable with Robotics theory.

In case the posts are not available anymore, [here](/docs/ros-transforms/ros-transforms.pdf) is the pdf version.
