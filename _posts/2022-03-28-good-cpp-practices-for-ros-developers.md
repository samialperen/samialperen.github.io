Multi-robot Systems (MRS) group at Czech Technical University in Prague has an amazing [website](https://ctu-mrs.github.io/) where they share practical information for robotics software engineers. I highly suggest to check their [Good practices in modern C++](https://ctu-mrs.github.io/docs/introduction/c_to_cpp.html) post. 


In case the posts are not available anymore, [here](/docs/good-cpp-practices-ros/Good practices in C++ - Multi-robot Systems Group UAV System.pdf) is the pdf version.
