**The Robot Report** is an amazing robotics news website. If you are interested
in robotics, you should definitely check it out. It is different than other 
sources that I mentioned in my previous [post](https://samialperen.github.io/2019/03/19/robotics-resources.html). This website focuses on newest robotics applications from business perspective. It introduces companies and their work related to robotics. Even if you are not interested in business side, I believe it is still useful to follow it in order to have a better understanding of your research and broaden your horizon. Checking coolest robots and autonomous systems in the morning while enjoying your coffee is a good start for the day :). You can check the website using [this link](https://www.therobotreport.com/).
