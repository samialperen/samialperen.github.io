As many roboticists are moving from **ROS1** to **ROS2**, there are still not too many resources on the web about the performance of ROS2 compared to ROS1. Robocup team "Hamburg Bit-Bots" shared their experience about moving from ROS1 to ROS2 for RoboCup Soccer league in their post [Experiences with ROS 2 on our robots](https://bit-bots.de/en/2022/07/experiences-with-ros-2-on-our-robots/). They share many practical tips and performance comparisons between ROS1 and ROS2. If you are planning to do the same and switch to ROS2, I highly suggest to take a look at their post.
