The video below by **Computerphile** describes the main working principle behind stereo RGB-D cameras and IR technology as well as integrating RGB-D data into **convolutional neural networks** (CNN)s using **Intel Realsense** camera as an example. Just a heads up, it is a short overview video, not a deep look into the subject.
