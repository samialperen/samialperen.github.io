If you are reading this post, probably you are already interested in AI and wanna self teach most important AI concepts to yourself. However, there are bunch of online sources that makes it difficult to choose between them. In my opinion, Jeremy Howard's [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and Andrew NG's [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) are among the best resources. I read on reddit that people have mixed opinions about which one to go with. This [medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/two-sides-of-the-same-coin-fast-ai-vs-deeplearning-ai-b67e9ec32133) by Michael Li is quite useful if you are not sure which one to choose.
