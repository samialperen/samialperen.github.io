I always loved working in the field of robotics. In my opinion, there is a huge difference between a software engineer and robotics software engineer since as robotics people we are working with closed loop systems and hardware a lot that brings a lot of challanges to the table. [The story of a bug](https://twitter.com/tessalau/status/1604018884662951938) occurred on the robots of [Dusty Robotics](https://www.dustyrobotics.com/) is a great example of how working with robots look like. I think everyone who is in the field or who wants to be become a robotics engineer, should read this story and decide whether it is something you might be willing to do. I admit it is very challenging, but once you figured out the root cause of the weird bug and fixed it, that satisfaction is priceless.
