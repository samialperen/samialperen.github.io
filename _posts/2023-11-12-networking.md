I am so glad to read the post [Networking as an introvert CTO](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/networking-introvert-cto/) by Vadim Kravcenko that talks about his perspective on networking as an introvert person. I am quite the opposite, an extrovert and social butterfly. However, his post contains so many useful points for everyone. Not only for networking, but I believe in general for all kind of relationships. Have a great read!
