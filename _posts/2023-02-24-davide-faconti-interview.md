The interview with **Davide Faconti**, Staff Robotics Engineer at PickNick and the main developer of **PlotJuggler** and **BehaviourTree.CPP** gave me a lot of insight about robotics industry. He has 20 years of experience working in the field. Especially his comment about being generalist vs specialist from robotics person is quite valuable. I highly suggest to follow the entire discussion.
