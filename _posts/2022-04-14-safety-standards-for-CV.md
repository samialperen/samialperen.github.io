Once I start working in industry and writing code in production level, I realized the gaps between the code written in research environment and industry. Moreover, most of the coding material online only focuses on how the code works and trying to explain the specific concept, but they do not put any emphasis on best practices and safety compliance. Especially if your code is running on hardware and have a potential to physically manipulate the environment, safety standars become **MANDATORY** since sometimes the lives of people are at stake. I highly suggest to read the LearnOpenCV blog post [AUTOSAR C++ compliant deep learning inference with TensorRT](https://learnopencv.com/autosar-c-compliant-deep-learning-inference-with-tensorrt/) to learn more about safety standards for industry level AI and robotics software.
