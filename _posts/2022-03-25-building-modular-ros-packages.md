I have been coming across a lot of good material related to robotics software engineering, and I decided to share them here as well in case someone finds it useful.

[Building Modular ROS Packages](https://jbohren.com/articles/modular-ros-packages) by Jonathan Bohren is a great post explaining how to take advantage of **CMake** to
better design our ROS packages make them easy to use by other projects. 

In case his website goes down, [here](/docs/Building_Modular_ROS_Packages.pdf) is the pdf version of his post.
