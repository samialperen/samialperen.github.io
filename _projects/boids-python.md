In this project, three main rules seperation, alignment and cohesion of Reynolds flocking algorithm was implemented in **Python** using p5 library. 
* Seperation: Agents move away from each other to avoid collisions   
* Alignment: Agents match their heading with other agents to move like a group
* Cohesion: Agents stay close to each other to form a group

Here is a picture that shows these rules: seperation (left), alignment (center) and cohesion (right)
