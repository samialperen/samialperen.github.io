# [Github Link for this project](https://github.com/samialperen/adaboost_vs_svm)

In this project, **Adaboost-M1 classifier** was implemented based on Linear **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. Its comparison was compared with linear SVMs to provide more understanding about the underlying mechanism behind Adaboost and SVM classifiers.

Keywords about the project:
* Machine Learning
    * Support Vector Machines 
    * Adaboost-M1
    * Cross-validation
    * Accuracy, mean, variance
* Python
    * sklearn
    * matplotlib
    * numpy
