In this project, boids inspired leader following **multi-robot** system was implemented in **Stage** simulator using **Robot Operating System (ROS)**. 
Quantitative metrics were developed to calculate performance. Experiments were conducted in simulation to test the proposed system and provide insight
about multi-robot system design.

Keywords about the project:
* Robot Operating System
    * Custom teleoperation 
    * Map server
    * Rosbag manipulator
* Stage (simulator)
* Multi-robot system
* Python
    * Pandas
* Statistics
    * ANOVA
    * Tukey's Significant Difference (HSD) test


Here is a video of the multi-robot system in action:
