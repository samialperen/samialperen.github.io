In this project, **ID3 Decision Tree Classifier Based on both Information Gain and Gain Ratio** was written from scratch in Python. It was used to classify **UCI Machine Learning Datasets** [Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame) and [Wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). The robustness of this classifier against attribute and class noise was measured. 

Keywords about the project:
* Machine Learning
