This project was my bachelor capstone project. We were asked to design and implement a mobile robot
to create the map of an unknown indoor environment. 

The project is about:
* Custom made cost-effective LIDAR 
    * Communication with ROS
* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
* Robot Operating System
    * Navigation Stack (Autonomous Navigation)
    * Hector SLAM, Cartographer SLAM, Gmapping, Karto SLAM, Lago SLAM, Core SLAM
    * ROS Serial
* Gazebo
* CAD Design (Solidworks)
* OpenCV
* PID Controllers
* Embedded Programming (ARM Cortex M10 & STM microprocessors)


Here is a mapping result after robot autonomosly navigated in the unknown area:
