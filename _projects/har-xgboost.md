# [Github Link for this project](https://github.com/samialperen/har_xgboost)

In this project, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier was trained after feature extraction with principal component analysis (PCA) in order to classify human activities. [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) was employed for training, and here are the accuracies after 10-times-10-fold cross validation:
```
Best Accuracy: 99.66%
Mean Accuracy: 95.39%
Var of Accuracy: 9.81%
```
