# [Github Link for this project](https://github.com/samialperen/pca_mnist)

In this project, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) without built-in functions was implemented in Python, and this implementation was used for image reconstruction on [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The goal of this side project was to show how PCA works with a solid example.
