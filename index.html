  <p> I am a Master of Applied Science student at University of Waterloo. I am a member of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/">Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Laboratory (SIRRL)</a>. My current research focuses on human multi-robot interaction and reinforcement learning for robotics. Particularly, I am trying to increase readability of robots' behaviour to human teammates to foster transparency and trustworthiness. In this regard, I am also interested in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) concepts. </p>
