  <p> I am robotics enthusiast who has been always fascinated by the developments in robotics and artificial intelligence. I have been working in robotics 
    (both professionally and academically) for seven years.
  
  <p> Previously, I was a Master of Applied Science student in the Systems Design Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo. I was a member of 
    <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/">Social and Intelligent 
    Robotics Research Laboratory (SIRRL)</a>.</p>
  <p>
    Research interests:
    <ul>
      <li>Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</li>
      <li>Robotics</li>
      <li>eXplanaible Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</li>
    </ul> 
  </p>

  <p> 
    I received a Master's of Applied Science (MAsc) degree from Systems Design Engineering 
    at the University of Waterloo with a focus on <strong>Robotics</strong> 
    and <strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> in August 2021. I did my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a specialization on <strong>Control Theory and Automation</strong>. 
    
    <p style="style=display:inline; color:red;"><strong>I am actively looking for a full-time job.</strong></p> 
    Some of the job titles that I am considering are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Robotics Software Engineer/Developer</li>
      <li>Robotics Engineer</li>
      <li>Robotic Vision Engineer/Developer</li>
